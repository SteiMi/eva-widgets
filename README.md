# EveryAware Widgets
In the repository we collect widgets for the **Gears** module of the [EveryAware platform](http://cs.everyaware.eu).
The Gears module allows to visualize, explore, and analyze the data collected using our generic data API.
We will include several advanced widgets as well as a variety of tutorials which show you how to write your own wdigets.
